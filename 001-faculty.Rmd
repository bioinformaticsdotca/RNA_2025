I am a PhD candidate at the University of Alberta with a strong interest in combining computational tools with biological research. My work involves using bioinformatics, multi-omics integration, and machine learning to study complex biological systems and extract meaningful insights from large datasets.
I am especially drawn to the challenge of working with high-dimensional data—developing analysis pipelines, applying statistical models, and exploring ways to make biological findings more interpretable and impactful.
